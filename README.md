Object-Oriented Project 1 Zoo  
By: Elmer Baca Holguin and Timothy Euken
=======================
This project is meant to show understanding of object oriented concepts.
Main concepts focused on were abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and identity.
The project is based on a zookeeper object doing a set of tests for subclasses that derive from
an animal super class.

How to use?
------------------
Main function class can be found under  
zookeeper-homework1\src\main\java\com\ZookeeperHomework1Application  
By running the main function the program will ask for a number of days for which the zookeeper  
will do their tasks for. That's the only input the program needs. Might need the spring framework but  
it should be included within the files.
